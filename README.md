# youtube-adaptive-speed
Uses YouTube transcript data to detect speaking pace and adjusts playback speed accordingly. Slow speakers get sped up, fast speakers get slowed down. Your chosen speed is also scaled to each speaker's pace.

⚠️ The extension relies video transcript data to determine speaking pace. If the video's transcription doesn't match the video's audio, the speed calculation will be wrong. In that case, you can always manually change the video speed from YouTube's settings, and it'll revert to the extension's speed for the other videos

⚠️ The extension might conflict with other extensions that change the YouTube video speed.
